				<h3>Warning: Outdated Version</h3>
				<p>This tutorial pertains to an outdated version of Ubuntu. While Ubuntu Saucy is still supported, a later version has been released. It is recommended that you consider <a href="how-to-install-ubuntu-14-04-trusty-tahr">installing Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr</a> instead.</p>

			<p>Ubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander came out on 17th of October 2013. Future releases will reoccur every 6 months (you can upgrade as easily as updating, it just takes a little longer) in April and October. Ubuntu 13.10 is the first version to have only 9 months of support, with previous releases offering 18 months as a minimum. This comes after the upgrade to five years of support of the last LTS release, Ubuntu 12.04.</p>

				<h3 id="warnings">Warnings</h3><p>When choosing how to install, some options will <strong>completely erase</strong> your drive before doing so. Please read carefully the description of your options below <em>before</em> choosing an install method. If you are comfortable managing partitions, we recommend doing so manually.</p>

			<h3 id="download">Downloading</h3>
			<p>You can <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Download Ubuntu 13.10</a> directly. The file size is just under a Gigabyte and may take anything from a few minutes to a few hours, depending primarily on your connection speed. Downloads will be faster after the first day of release (as less people download).</p>
			<h4 id="architecture">32 or 64 Bit</h4>
			<p>A good general rule of thumb is if your computer has 4GB of RAM or more, go for 64bit. Less, go for 32bit.</p>
			<p>You might need to know how to find out how much ram you have, if you don't already know, in <a href="how-to-find-out-how-much-ram-is-installed-in-ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows7/Find-out-how-much-RAM-your-computer-has" target="_blank">Windows</a>, or <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2353?viewlocale=en_US" target="_blank">OS X</a>. You might want to take a look at the <a title="Pros and Cons of 32 and 64bit systems." href="how-to-decide-if-you-should-use-32bit-or-64bit-ubuntu#what" target="_blank">pros and cons</a>.</p>
			<p>Basically, 64bit is faster.</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="media">CD, DVD or USB</h3>
			<p>To install Ubuntu, you must first put the installation image onto some form of media. Your choices are CD, DVD or USB. Most computers can boot from both, unless they lack a disc drive, in which case you can skip the next paragraph, as you'll be using a USB then.</p>
			<p>CDs and DVDs offer no real advantage over one another, DVDs may be larger, but the space will not be used, but cost only a tiny amount more. RW means you can write new data again and again, whereas R means once the Ubuntu installation image is on there, there it will stay. It can be used again, but never written to again. As for + or -, + means a computer can treat it like a USB drive, whereas - is a little older and won't. Either + or -, and R or RW will work for this.</p>
			<p>USB sticks need to be at least 2GB in size, and be prepared for it to be formatted (everything deleted).</p>

			<p>Once you've put the image you downloaded onto a CD, DVD, or USB, you will need to shut down your computer. This may be a good time to print this page, or just read through and make notes.</p>
			<p>Turn your computer back on, tapping F12 to select a boot device when your screen shows the name of the manufacturer. You can then use the arrow keys, finally hitting enter, to select either USB or Disc Drive.</p>

			<h4>1. Click Install</h4>
			<p>Once Ubuntu has booted, you will be presented with a screen that looks like this.</p>
			<p>Click <span class="box">Install Ubuntu</span> to install. You can open the installer again later if you choose to try it out, but remember it will be far slower running from a Disc/USB than had you installed it, and nothing you do will actually be saved.</p>

			<h4>2. Check both Boxes</h4>
			<p>We recommend checking both boxes, but if you don't want to install all updates while installing, or don't want to play MP3 files (music), then you can leave the relevant box(es) unchecked.</p>
			<p>If you don't have at least 4.5GB of available drive space, then you can't continue. If you're not plugged in, then plug in before continuing. If you're not connected to the internet, then you'll be prompted to connect when you click continue. You can do it now using the icon to the left of the sound menu to connect. Mine shows two arrows, as I'm plugged in, disconnected it looks different, and a little change again if using WiFi. You can continue without connecting, but you won't be able to get updates, or any language packs you may require.</p>

			<h4>3. Choose How to Install</h4>
			<p>Yours will probably look a little different to mine here. My hard drive doesn't have anything on it yet, so i can choose either to use the whole disk, or specify partitions manually (surprisingly easy stuff). Yours may have a slightly different first option, and one or two extra.</p>
			<p>It may say <span class="box">Delete Windows and Install Ubuntu</span> and <span class="box">Shrink Windows and Install Ubuntu Alongside</span>.</p>

			<p>Now you get to enter your name, the name you want your computer to be (not really important), your username (again, you won't see this much, but it can't have capitals or spaces, best leave as it is made from your real name), a password (if you want, then confirm it, and keep it strong), whether or not to log in automatically, and whether or not to encrypt your home folder (which is where documents, music, and video folder can be found, among others).</p>
			<p>I would not recommend encrypting your home folder, as this usually complicates things for you as much as any potential trespassers. It can lead to complications with keyrings, forgotten passwords, and bad data recovery. Only use if it is company policy.</p>
