			<h3 id="release-date">Release Date</h3>
			<p>Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr was released on 17th April 2014, and future releases will reoccur every 6 months (you can upgrade as easily as updating, it just takes a little longer) in April and October.</p>

		<div class="col span_1_of_2">
			<h3 id="lts">Long Term Support</h3>
			<p>5 Years of support for this release, makes it good for people who don't want to constantly change, or even have to pay for upgrades (shudder). That makes it good for business or servers that you don't want to be doing major upgrades on too often.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>Tahrs are three species of large Asian ungulates related to the wild goat. Until recently the three species were believed to be closely related and were placed in a single genus, Hemitragus.</p>

			<cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahr">Wikipedia</a>	</cite>
			<p>Ubuntu release have always had the code-naming convention of an animal name as the second part, preceded by an adjective beginning with the same letter. Apart from the first two releases (back in 2004/5), they have been working through the alphabet (starting at B and missing C). While the animals honored in this way are not necessarily unheard of, many of them are either uncommon or infamous in some way. I would be surprised if most people could tell me what an Eft or an Ibex was. Or a Narwhal, or an Ocelot.</p>
