			<h4 id="animals">Animals</h4>
			<p>A Pangolin is a nocturnal scaly anteater, or Trenggiling, and is a mammal of the order Pholidota. One of eight species, but with no other families (Manidae) or genera (Manis), Pangolins have large keratin scales covering their skin and are the only mammals with this adaptation. They are found in tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The name "pangolin" derives from the Malay word pengguling ("something that rolls up"). Ubuntu release have always had the code-naming convention of an animal name as the second part, preceded by an adjective beginning with the same letter. Apart from the first two releases (back in 2004/5), they have been working through the alphabet (starting at B and missing C).</p>
			<p>While the animals honored in this way are not necessarily unheard of, many of them are either uncommon or infamous in some way. I would be surprised if most people could tell me what an Eft or an Ibex was. Or a Narwhal, or an Ocelot. For the curious amongst you, i will save you some googling. An <a href="https://www.google.com/search&quest;tbm=isch&amp;amp&semi;q=eft&plus;animal&amp;amp&semi;qscrl=1">Eft</a> is a kind of Red Newt, whereas and <a href="https://www.google.com/search&quest;tbm=isch&amp;amp&semi;q=ibex&amp;amp&semi;qscrl=1">Ibex</a> is a mountain goat. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search&quest;tbm=isch&amp;amp&semi;q=narwhal&amp;amp&semi;qscrl=1">Narwhal</a> is a kind of Unicorned Whale (no, really, they live in the arctic). A <a href="https://www.google.com/search&quest;tbm=isch&amp;amp&semi;q=ocelot&amp;amp&semi;qscrl=1">Ocelot</a>is a wild cat, like a small leopard. Some people keep them as pets.</p>
