			<blockquote>
				<p>The beaver is a large, primarily nocturnal, semiaquatic rodent. Castor includes two extant species, the North American beaver (native to North America) and Eurasian beaver (Eurasia). Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6â€“12 million. This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.</p>

			<p>Ubuntu release have always had the code-naming convention of an animal name as the second part, preceded by an adjective beginning with the same letter. Apart from the first two releases (back in 2004/5), they have been working through the alphabet (starting at B and missing C). While the animals honored in this way are not necessarily unheard of, many of them are either uncommon or infamous in some way.</p>
