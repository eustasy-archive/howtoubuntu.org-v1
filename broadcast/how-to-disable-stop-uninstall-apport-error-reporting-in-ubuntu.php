	<h2>How to Disable, Stop or Uninstall Apport Error Reporting</h2>

	<p>Ubuntu 12.04 is the first release of Ubuntu that ships with Apport Error Reporting enabled by default, and as a result, you may get a large quantity of <span class="box">Internal System Error</span> popups inside Ubuntu. Similar popups may also read <span class="box">Sorry, Ubuntu 12.04 has experienced an internal error.</span> These popups are part of Apport, an internal debugger which automatically generate reports to submit for packages that crash. Many reports can't be filed or have already been filed, and as such it is usually safe to turn off.</p>
	<h3 id="information">Information</h3>
	<p>Apport is an Error Reporting Service provided by Ubuntu to intercept and analyze crashes and bugs as and when they occur. Crashes and Bugs may sound like bad things, but actually most operating systems will have several a day, and it doesn't mean your computer is broken, nor does it necessarily stop working. As such, Apport can usually be safely disabled, as it doesn't fix anything, it just tells developers that something went wrong.</p>
