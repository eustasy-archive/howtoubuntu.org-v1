			<p class="important">If you are not familiar or comfortable adding PPAs and installing software through the command line, then you can accomplish everything we wish to do with the <span class="box">Update Manager</span>, but it may take slightly longer.</p>
			<p>In Precise, open your <span class="box">Update Manager</span>. Then, click <span class="box">Settings</span>. Under the <span class="box">Other Software</span> tab, click <span class="box">Add</span>. Paste the following line into the box and enter your password when prompted.</p>
			<input type="text" class="code" value="deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/otto-kesselgulasch/gimp/ubuntu precise main">
			<p>Repeat for this line.</p>
			<input type="text" class="code" value="deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/otto-kesselgulasch/gimp/ubuntu precise main">
			<p>Close the Software Sources window and Check for Updates.</p>
			<p>Open the Software Centre and search for Gimp, or just <a href="apt:gimp" class="box">Install Gimp</a>.</p><p>Once you've found it or clicked that link (which you may be asked to confirm, tick the checkbox so you don't get asked again), you'll need to click <span class="box">Install</span> in the top-right-hand-corner of the Software Centre.</p>

			<p>Adding the repository, updating, and installing the latest gimp, can be done via one unified command. You will need to enter your (administrator) password, and then press <span class="box">Enter</span> (sometimes called return) when prompted to confirm the addition of a new (and previously untrusted) software source.</p>
			<input type="text" class="code" value="sudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gimp">
			<p>If you prefer, or just for explanatory purposes, these are the individual commands, where <span class="box">&&</span> runs the commands one after the other.</p>
			<p>This command adds the new Software Repository.</p>
			<input type="text" class="code" value="sudo add-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp">
			<p>This command Updates the Software Sources, so your computer knows what software is available in your new repository.</p>
			<input type="text" class="code" value="sudo apt-get update">
			<p>This command installs Gimp, or updates it is it is already installed. It will also install or update any dependencies (required packages/software).</p>
			<input type="text" class="code" value="sudo apt-get install gimp">
